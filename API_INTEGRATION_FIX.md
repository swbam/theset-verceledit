# TheSet API Integration Fix

This document outlines the issues identified and fixes implemented to resolve the critical API integration failures in TheSet application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Empty Setlist Songs Array**: In the show route, there was a bug where an empty array was being inserted into the setlist_songs table, resulting in no songs being added to setlists.

2. **Column Name Inconsistency**: The setlist processing was using `last_updated` instead of `updated_at` and there were inconsistencies between `title` and `name` fields.

3. **Vote Function Parameter Mismatch**: The vote functions in SQL were referencing `p_song_id` as a setlist_song ID, but the implementation was treating it as a song ID.

4. **Spotify Data Structure Inconsistency**: The tracks fetched from Spotify were stored with minimal information, but other parts of the code expected additional fields.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Show Route Setlist Creation

- Removed the empty array insertion in the show route
- Improved error handling for setlist song creation
- Added batch insertion for better performance

### 2. Fixed Column Name Inconsistencies

- Updated the setlist processing to use `updated_at` instead of `last_updated`
- Ensured consistent use of `name` field for setlist songs

### 3. Fixed Vote Functions

- Added clear documentation to the vote functions to indicate they operate on setlist_song IDs
- Improved error handling in the vote action
- Added verification that the setlist_song exists before voting

### 4. Fixed DataLoader Component

- Updated the DataLoader component to use the correct column names
- Added proper ordering by position and vote count for setlist songs
- Improved error handling for data loading

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-new-migrations.js
   ```
   This will apply the necessary database migrations to update the schema.

2. **Run Integration Test**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-setlist-integration.js
   ```
   This script tests the full flow from artist creation to setlist creation and voting.

## User Flow

The application now follows the outlined user flow:

1. Users search for artists with upcoming shows
2. View concert listings for selected artists
3. Access show pages with interactive setlists populated from Spotify
4. Participate in community voting that persists and dynamically reorders songs based on vote counts

## Data Flow

The API data flow has been fixed to establish a seamless import pipeline:

1. **Ticketmaster API**: Provides artist search results and concert details
2. **Spotify API**: Provides artist tracks for setlists
3. **Supabase Database**: All information correctly persists with proper relationships

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that all migrations have been applied successfully
3. Ensure that the environment variables for Ticketmaster, Spotify, and Supabase are correctly set
4. Run the integration test to verify the fixes are working as expected

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more comprehensive error logging
2. Implement additional tests for edge cases
3. Add monitoring for API rate limits and failures
